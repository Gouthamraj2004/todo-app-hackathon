---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Username/password and Google OAuth login  
✅ Add, edit, delete, and filter tasks  
✅ Responsive UI with Material UI  
✅ JWT-based session management  
✅ Secure secret handling via .env  
✅ Modular, scalable codebase
---
## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app-hackathon.git
   cd todo-app-hackathon
   ```
2.Create .env in the /backend directory:
```bash
MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```
3.Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
4.Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
5.Start the backend server:
```bash
cd ../backend
npx nodemon server.js
```
Start the frontend React app in another terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to use the app.

## 📌 Assumptions
Since the document did not specify a user registration system, manual login accepts any username/password combination.

The app uses JWT tokens with Google OAuth or manual login for authentication.

MongoDB Atlas is assumed as the database backend.

## ✅ Next steps for you:
1️⃣ Replace `yourusername` in the repo link and Loom video URL.  
2️⃣ Add your actual architecture diagram image as `architecture-diagram.png` in your repo root.  
3️⃣ Deploy your app publicly (Render for backend, Netlify/Vercel for frontend) so it meets the “publicly deployed submission” requirement.  
4️⃣ Commit your `README.md`:
```bash
git add README.md architecture-diagram.png
git commit -m "Add README with instructions, assumptions, and diagram"
git push origin main
```
